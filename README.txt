Ontology is the philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality. 
It is part of the major branch of philosophy known as metaphysics. Ontology deals with questions
 about what things exist or can be said to exist, and how such 
entities can be grouped according to similarities and differences. In the example bellow I
 made a tree and plant ontology using the protégé program.
